## Required API Keys

### Essential APIs
1. **Unsplash API** (Recommended for high-quality images)
   - Sign up at: https://unsplash.com/developers
   - Add `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to your `.env.local`

2. **Pexels API** (For images and videos)
   - Sign up at: https://www.pexels.com/api/
   - Add `PEXELS_API_KEY` to your `.env.local`

3. **Pixabay API** (Fallback for images)
   - Sign up at: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
   - Add `PIXABAY_API_KEY` to your `.env.local`

4. **Arcjet** (Rate limiting)
   - Sign up at: https://arcjet.com/
   - Add `ARCJET_KEY` to your `.env.local`

### Optional APIs
- **Google Maps API** (For enhanced Street View)
- **Weather API** (For weather integration)
- **Lygosap API** (For Mobile Money payments in Cameroon)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup
Make sure your Convex database is set up with the updated schema:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Feature Configuration

### Rate Limiting Plans
The system supports 4 subscription tiers:

1. **Basic (Free)**
   - 1 trip per day
   - Basic AI planning
   - Standard features

2. **Pro (5,000 XAF/month)**
   - 10 trips per month
   - Advanced AI planning
   - Premium features

3. **Premium (9,000 XAF/2 months)**
   - 20 trips per 2 months
   - Expert AI planning
   - All features including VR tours

4. **Enterprise (25,000 XAF/year)**
   - Unlimited trips
   - AI insights
   - Team collaboration

### Media Gallery Configuration
The gallery automatically fetches real images and videos from:
- Unsplash (primary source for high-quality images)
- Pexels (images and videos)
- Pixabay (fallback for images)

If APIs are not configured, it falls back to Unsplash's source API.

### Virtual Tour Integration
- Uses Google Street View embed API
- Automatically generates multiple viewpoints per destination
- Supports 360° panoramic views
- Includes fallback to Google Maps search

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
1. Check if API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Verify API key permissions and quotas
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
4. Ensure fallback URLs are accessible

### Rate Limiting Issues
1. Verify Arcjet API key is correct
2. Check user subscription status in database
3. Review rate limiting rules in `/api/trip-limit/route.ts`
4. Test with different user accounts

### Payment Processing
1. Ensure payment API endpoints are configured
2. Check Convex database connection
3. Verify subscription update mutations
4. Test with different payment methods

### Virtual Tours Not Working
1. Check Google Maps API key and permissions
2. Verify Street View API is enabled
3. Test with different destinations
4. Check iframe embedding permissions

## Performance Optimization

### Image Loading
- Images are lazy-loaded for better performance
- Thumbnails are used for gallery previews
- Error handling prevents broken image displays
- Caching is implemented for repeated requests

### Animation Performance
- CSS animations are hardware-accelerated
- Animations are disabled on slower devices
- Reduced motion preferences are respected
- Smooth transitions with proper timing

### API Rate Limiting
- Intelligent caching reduces API calls
- Fallback systems prevent service interruption
- Rate limits are enforced per user and plan
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
Ensure all production environment variables are set:
- API keys for media services
- Database connection strings
- Payment processor credentials
- Rate limiting configurations

### Database Migrations
Run Convex migrations for the updated schema:
```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### CDN Configuration
Consider using a CDN for:
- Static assets and images
- CSS and JavaScript files
- API response caching

### Monitoring
Set up monitoring for:
- API usage and quotas
- Payment processing success rates
- User subscription status
- Rate limiting effectiveness

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Monitor API usage and costs
2. Update subscription plans and pricing
3. Review rate limiting effectiveness
4. Optimize image loading performance

### Updates and Improvements
1. Add new media sources as needed
2. Enhance virtual tour locations
3. Improve payment processing
4. Optimize user experience based on feedback
